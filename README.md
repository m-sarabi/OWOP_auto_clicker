# OWOP_auto_clicker

First of all, idk much java script it was the best I could do right now. I might write javascripts and add tools later when I learn how to.

## How To:

Run the main.py, enter the zoom level and which tool you want to use, and enjoy.
"All the way zoomed in" id is 1, if you zoom out one level with "zoom tool", id is 2 and next is 3. other zoom levels are not supported,
because pixels are too small and are not accurate anymore

### Painter:

This tool is to paste images on the board (idk why I named it paint instead of paste).

- Choose the image you want to draw
- Wait until sorting pixels are finished
- move the mouse to the lower right corner of where you want the image to be drawn and press "CTRL + V"

## To-Do list:

- Adding text tool to type a pixelated text
- Building a standalone version with gui (very long term, xd)
