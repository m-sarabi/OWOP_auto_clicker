First of all, idk much java script it was the best I could do right now. I might write javascripts and add tools later
when I learn how to.

## How To:

Run the main.py, enter the zoom level and which tool you want to use, and enjoy.
"All the way zoomed in" id is 1, if you zoom out one level with "zoom tool", id is 2 and next is 3. other zoom levels
are not supported, because pixels are too small and are not accurate anymore

### Paste Image:

This tool is to paste images on the board.
- Choose a file or an image from clipboard
- Wait until sorting pixels are finished
- move the mouse to the lower right corner of where you want the image to be drawn and press "CTRL + V"

### Write Text

- Write your text in the console and press Enter
- press "CTRL + V" where you want to write your text

## To-Do list:

- Building a standalone version with gui (very long term, xd)
- Add a small font version for the writer tool
- Optimise sorting pixels (it is super slow right now)
